# Learning-C
Private Repo for me learning C/C+

Done in Sample order using the GNU Compiler

Following compilation command:

g++ -o <output_file_name> -pedantic -asci <input_file_name.cpp>

-o 
means: specifying the output name. You could write it as: g++ <input_file_name.cpp> -o <output_file_name>
whatever is after -o is the output name.

-ansci 
enables support for ISO C89

-pedantic
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++
